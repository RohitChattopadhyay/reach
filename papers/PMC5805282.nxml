      <abstract>
        <p>It has been known that EGF-like factor secreted from LH-stimulated granuloma cells acts on granulosa cells and cumulus cells to induce ovulation process. Granulosa cells are changed the morphology with differentiating cell functions to produce progesterone. Cumulus cells are detached to make a space between the cells to accumulate hyaluronan rich matrix. LH also changes extracellular matrix (ECM) components including fibronectin in the follicular walls and granulosa cell layers. EGF like factor and fibronectin synergistically play important roles in numerous cell functions, especially cancer cell migration, estimating that fibronectin would impact on granulosa cells and cumulus cells. To clear this hypothesis, the localizations of fibronectin and its receptor integrin were observed by immunofluorescence technique. The functions were monitored by the detection of downstream signaling pathway, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The pharmacological approach in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> were used for analyzing the physiological roles of FAK during ovulation process. The immunofluorescence staining revealed that fibronectin and integrin were observed in granulosa cells, cumulus cells and the space between cumulus cells and oocyte at 4 and 8 h after hCG injection. Concomitantly with the changes of fibronectin-integrin localization, FAK was phosphorylated in periovulatory follicles. The injection of FAK inhibitor suppressed not only ovulation but also luteinization of granulosa cells and cumulus expansion. In cultured-granulosa cells, fibronectin-integrin synergistically activated FAK with amphiregulin (AREG). Such cooperative stimulations induced a morphological change in granulosa cells, which resulted in the maximum level of progesterone production via the induction of <italic>Hsd3b</italic>. When cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured with AREG in the presence of serum, the maximum level of cumulus expansion was observed. The AREG-induced cumulus expansion was also suppressed by FAK inhibitor. Thus, it is concluded that fibronectin and AREG synergistically activate FAK not only in granulosa cells and cumulus cells to induce successful ovulation process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Luteinizing hormone (LH) is transiently secreted from pituitary glands and acts on its receptor expressed on granulosa cells to induce ovulation process [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In LH-stimulated granulosa cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like factor is expressed and secreted to act on its receptor, EGFR, in both granulosa cells and cumulus cells [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The downstream pathway of EGFR in follicular somatic cells is mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK1/3), also called ERK1/2, because in <italic>Mapk1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>;Mapk3</italic><sup><italic>flox;flox</italic></sup><italic>;Cyp19Cre</italic> mice that MAPK1/3 are deleted in granulosa cells and cumulus cells, ovulation is completely suppressed [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the mutant mouse, almost all genes reported to be expressed in granulosa cells and cumulus cells during ovulation process are not expressed after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], indicating that the function of EGFR changes the gene expression pattern from the follicular development stage to ovulation process.</p>
      <p>Activation of EGFR is also involved in cell migration and morphological changes of the cell shape [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The EGF-like factor-EGFR pathway increases the enzymatic activity of calpain 2 via both Ca<sup>2+</sup> induction and ERK1/2 activation in cumulus cells during ovulation process [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Calpain-degraded focal adhesion components, such as paxicillin and tallin, induce cytoskeleton remodeling in cumulus cells, and this induction is essential for the detachment of cumulus cells and cell migration during ovulation process of the mouse cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Modification of the cytoskeleton is also observed in granulosa cells during ovulation process [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When the mutant type of cofilin, one of the focal adhesion mediators, was overexpressed in cultured granulosa cells, not only actin remodeling but also progesterone production was not induced in the cells [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cofilin is known to be regulated by an EGFR-dependent pathway in fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], indicating that the EGF-like factor-EGFR pathway induces differentiation of granulosa cells and cumulus cells during ovulation process via both changes in gene expression patterns and morphological changes of the cells. However, the latter mechanisms that change the shape of both granulosa cells and cumulus cells have been unclear.</p>
      <p>Focal adhesion components bind to integrins, which are transmembrane proteins, and recognize changes in extracellular environments to maintain or change the cell shape [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The major binding partner of integrins is fibronectin, a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of organs including ovarian follicles [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. During follicular development and ovulation, ECM components change kinetically in the follicular walls and granulosa cell layers. In preantral and early antral follicles, the follicular walls consist of laminin, collagen and perlecan [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After the LH surge, granulosa cells express fibronectin and laminin that accumulate within the granulosa cell layers [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These changes in ECM components affect granulosa cell functions at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. Huet et al. [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that, when granulosa cells were cultured on a collagen-coated surface, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) enhanced estrogen production compared with granulosa cells without collagen. Conversely, coating with fibronectin or laminin induces progesterone production, suggesting that ECM components support EGF-like factor-EGFR-induced luteinization of granulosa cells. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an assembly point of both signaling pathways, where integrins mediate the phosphorylation of Tyr397 of FAK and the EGFR pathway induces phosphorylation of Tyr925 of FAK in a Src-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The both phosphorylation sites of FAK leads to the maximum enzymatic activity of FAK to induce the differentiation and migration of cells [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that EGFR and integrin signaling pathways, which change the shapes of granulosa cells and cumulus cells, would be essential for the differentiation of both cell types. However, there is limited information about the relationship between the functions of integrins and the EGFR pathway in cumulus cells and granulosa cells during ovulation. Moreover, little is known about the direct or indirect effects of ECM components in periovulatory follicles on oocyte maturation.</p>
      <p>To test the above hypothesis, we focused on fibronectin in granulosa cells, cumulus cells and oocyte during ovulation process. We investigated the kinetic changes of fibronectin and integrin in periovulatory follicles and their roles in activation of the FAK pathway. Using primary <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of granulosa cells, we also examined whether fibronectin and/or EGF are required for the phosphorylation of FAK. Finally, using a pharmacological approach, the roles of FAK and the binding of fibronectin to integrins in granulosa cells and cumulus cells during ovulation were analyzed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

        <p>Immature female C57BL/6 mice (3 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Japan (Yokohama, Japan). At 23 days of age, female mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 4 IU eCG to stimulate follicular growth, followed by 5 IU hCG after 48 h to stimulate ovulation and luteinization. Animals were housed under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle in the Experiment Animal Center at Hiroshima University and provided with food and water ad libitum. Mice were euthanized using CO<sub>2</sub> administration method. The animals were treated in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

        <p>Immature female mice were injected i.p. with 4 IU eCG. After 48 h, the mice were injected i.p. with 5 IU hCG and/or 30 mg/kg Y15 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The treatment significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of FAK (Tyr925) in ovaries at 4 h after hCG injection when the maximum level of phosphorylation was induced by hCG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192458.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). At 4, 8, 10, and 16 h after hCG injection, their ovaries were collected. Ovaries collected from three mice in each treatment group at each time point (0, 8, 10 or 16 h after hCG injection) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Sakura-Finet Japan, Osaka, Japan). RNA was purified from granulosa cells isolated from periovulatory follicles of ovaries of one mouse and then used for real-time PCR. Three mice in each treatment group at each time point (0, 4 or 8 h after hCG injection) were used for RNA analyses. At 16 h after hCG injection, we collected the ovulated COCs from oviducts of five mice in each treatment group and counted the number of ovulated oocytes.</p>

        <p>Total RNA was obtained from mouse ovaries using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions, and real-time PCR analyses were performed as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, total RNA was reverse transcribed using 500 ng poly-dT (Invitrogen) and 0.25 U avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) at 42&#xB0;C for 75 min and then 95&#xB0;C for 5 min. cDNA and primers were added to a 15 &#x3BC;l total reaction volume of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCRs were then performed using the StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Conditions were set to the following parameters: 10 min at 95&#xB0;C followed by 45 cycles of 15 sec at 95&#xB0;C and 1 min at 60&#xB0;C.

        <title>Measurements of the surface area of an expanded COC, the size of cultured granulosa cells, and the number of stress fibers in cultured granulosa cells</title>
        <p>To determine the area of each expanded COC in ovarian sections, the sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The surface area of each COC was assessed in sections containing an oocyte with a nucleus. An area measurement system associated with the BZ-9000 microscope was used for measurements of the surface area of expanded COCs. Fifteen COCs were analyzed in each ovary. The ovaries were collected from three mice in each treatment group at each time point.</p>
        <p>To determine the surface area and number of stress fibers in the cultured granulosa cells, they were stained for F-actin. For quantitative analysis of the area or the number of stress fibers in each granulosa cell, Z-stacks were captured at seven steps over a Z-axis distance of 0.3 &#x3BC;m using the BZ-9000 microscope. Stacks were reconstructed and analyzed by the Keyence application for the BZ-9000, which allowed us to determine the fluorescent area and count the number of stress fibers in each cell. Fifteen cells per culture were analyzed.</p>

        <title>Effects of the FAK inhibitor on ovulation including cumulus expansion of COCs, luteinization of granulosa cells, and release of oocytes to the oviduct</title>
        <p>To clarify the roles of FAK activated by both fibronectin and EGF-like factor in granulosa cells during ovulation, FAK inhibitor Y15 was co-injected with hCG, and then we examined its effects on ovulation, cumulus expansion of COCs, and both the morphology and function of granulosa cells.</p>
        <p>At 8 h after hCG injection, cumulus cells had detached from the outer layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192458.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and the area of COCs was increased significantly in the control ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192458.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, in mice injected with both hCG and Y15, the cumulus layers were tightly surrounding oocytes and the area of COCs was significantly smaller than in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192458.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). At high magnification, both cumulus cells and granulosa cells had changed to an elliptical shape in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192458.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, treatment with Y15 did not induce the morphological change of cumulus cells and granulosa cells, and the cells remained in a spherical shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192458.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). At 16 h after hCG injection, ovulation occurred and the corpus luteum was formed in the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192458.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). There were more than 50 ovulated oocytes in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192458.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>FAK is one of key regulators of cellular functions due to remodeling of the cytoskeleton; however, there is little information in ovary during ovulation process. The present study revealed that in ovary, FAK was expressed and was transiently phosphorylated during ovulation process. The phosphorylation of FAK was dependent on EGFR ligand AREG and fibronectin in cultured granulosa cells. The physiological roles of FAK in periovulatory follicles were examined using a pharmacological approach by co-injecting FAK inhibitor Y15 into super ovulation-induced mice. Y15 directly binds to Tyr397 of FAK to reduce its kinase activity, which markedly suppresses the migration of cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. During ovulation process, detachment and migration of cumulus cells are induced to create space between cumulus cells for accumulation of the hyaluronan-rich matrix [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The hCG-induced expansion of cumulus cell layers was suppressed by treatment with Y15 concomitantly with the reductions of <italic>Has2</italic> and <italic>Ptgs2</italic> expression. <italic>In vitro</italic> culture also revealed that both Y15 and RGD peptide directly but slightly suppressed cumulus expansion without any expression of genes involved in hyaluronan synthesis or its accumulation. The differences would be explained by AREG- and PGE2-positive feedback loop to induce the expansion of cumulus cell layer during ovulation process [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. FAK was required for the production of PGE2 and AREG in granulosa cells. In cumulus cells, the PGE2 and AREG induced <italic>Has2</italic> expression and FAK was involved in the migration of cumulus cells but not the production of hyaluronic acid during ovulation process. In some knockout (KO) mouse models with defects in cumulus expansion, such as <italic>Ptgs2</italic>KO, <italic>Ptx3</italic>KO and <italic>Tnfaip6</italic>KO mice, the number of ovulated oocytes is also significantly but not completely decreased [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the present study, treatment with Y15 significantly decreased the number of ovulated oocytes, and several antral follicles but less numbers of corpus luteum were observed in the treated ovary. These data indicate that FAK in both granulosa cells and cumulus cells indirectly or directly induces the migration of cumulus cells, which is required for successful ovulation process.</p>
      <p>In glomerular podocytes, Y15 also affects the cell shape [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], indicating that FAK is involved in cellular functions due to remodeling of the cytoskeleton because the change in cell shape is driven by actin depolymerization or polymerization [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Formation of the corpus luteum, including changes of the granulosa cell shape, was also suppressed by injection of Y15 with hCG. The circular shape of granulosa cells in preovulatory follicles was stretched with stress fiber formation. Stress fibers consist of actin and myosin, and actin polymerization is induced in a Rho GTPase family-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. FAK is also involved in the formation of stress fibers, because FAK activity increases in Rho-stimulated cells [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, treatments with both AREG and fibronectin, but not either alone induced the phosphorylation of Tyr925 in FAK in granulosa cells with the formation of stress fibers. The inductions were correlated with the expression of genes involved in granulosa cell luteinization. In epithelial cells, mechanical tension during wound closure also induces stress fiber assemblies, which then differentiate into myoepithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induced to undergo chondrogenic differentiation have more pronounced actin stress fibers compared with undifferentiated MSCs [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moreover, actin stress fiber formation in response to TGF-&#x3B2; is also important for myofibroblast differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, AREG and fibronectin synergistically progress the luteinization of granulosa cells via FAK-induced stress fiber formation.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the addition of Y15 or RGD peptide to oocyte maturation medium decreased the rate of the MII stage when COCs were cultured with AREG in the presence of FBS. In the <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation (IVM) of oocytes, serum-free chemically defined medium results in a much lower maturation rate compared with serum-containing medium [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Removal of cumulus cells before IVM also dramatically decreases the rate of maturation in human, porcine, cattle and mouse oocytes [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Because serum contains fibronectin and cumulus cells supply fibronectin, the low maturation rate of denuded oocytes or in chemically defined medium may be induced by the lack of fibronectin during oocyte maturation process. In the fields of human infertility care and regenerative medicine, chemical defined medium is highly recommended to reduce the risk of infection [<xref rid="pone.0192458.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover, removal of cumulus cells is required to check the maturation of oocytes recovered from hormone-stimulated patients before injection of sperm (ICSI). Thus, it is possibility that the addition of fibronectin is to improve the IVM technique of human oocytes.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, during ovulation, the structure of follicles changes dramatically with the alteration of microenvironments in periovulatory follicles. The presence of fibronectin in granulosa cell layers and the space between cumulus cells create the basis for their differentiation. EGF-like factor acts on granulosa cells and cumulus cells enclosed by fibronectin to drive the dynamic changes of the cytoskeleton with the differentiation of each cell type, cumulus expansion of cumulus cells, and luteinization of granulosa cells. Thus, it is concluded that both EGF-like factor and fibronectin synergistically act on granulosa and cumulus cells to induce successful ovulation process.</p>
