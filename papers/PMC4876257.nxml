      <abstract>
        <p>Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that a therapeutic effect results from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) transplant. No systematic information is currently available regarding whether donor age modifies MSC regenerative potential on cutaneous wound healing. Here, we evaluate whether donor age influences this potential. Two different doses of bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs) from young, adult, or old mouse donors or two doses of their acellular derivatives mesenchymal stromal cells (acd-MSCs) were intradermally injected around wounds in the midline of C57BL/6 mice. Every two days, wound healing was macroscopically assessed (wound closure) and microscopically assessed (reepithelialization, dermal-epidermal junction, skin appendage regeneration, granulation tissue, leukocyte infiltration, and density dermal collagen fibers) after 12 days from MSC transplant. Significant differences in the wound closure kinetic, quality, and healing of skin regenerated were observed in lesions which received BM-MSCs from different ages or their acd-MSCs compared to lesions which received vehicle. Nevertheless, our data shows that adult's BM-MSCs or their acd-MSCs were the most efficient for recovery of most parameters analyzed. Our data suggest that MSC efficacy was negatively affected by donor age, where the treatment with adult's BM-MSCs or their acd-MSCs in cutaneous wound promotes a better tissue repair/regeneration. This is due to their paracrine factors secretion.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Many preclinical studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) enhance a regenerative wound microenvironment. In different animal models, such as full thickness excisional wound [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], diabetic foot ulcer [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], pressure ulcers [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and burn injury [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the administration of MSCs improves wound healing, by means of the increased accelerated wound closure, reduced scarring, promoting of collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and improved tensile strength.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, several clinical trials have shown that MSCs are safe and therapeutic in the treatment of chronic wounds [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], limb ischemia [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], diabetic foot ulcer [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and radiation burn [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These studies reported that administration of MSCs has produced clinical improvements including increased perfusion, decreased pain, reduction of ulcer size, and modulating of the radiation inflammatory processes and an improvement of wound repair, respectively.</p>
      <p>Although the mechanisms by which MSCs ameliorate tissue damage have been the subjects of debate for years, two theories currently offer explanations for these cells' therapeutic effects: (i) their differentiation or transdifferentiation into parenchymal cells [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or (ii) their bioactive soluble factor production (growth factors, cytokines, and specific proteins) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Historically, MSCs were considered to be hypoimmunogeneic because MSCs exhibit low levels of expression of MHC-I, no expression of either MHC class II markers, and costimulatory molecules, which allows them to avoid immunosurveillance [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, allogeneic MSCs could be more effective than the use of patient-derived dysfunctional autologous MSCs. In this context, an aspect of relevant importance donor age-related differences. Even though it has long been known that advanced age is negatively correlated with an organism's reparative and regenerative potential, scarce, conflicting systematic information is available concerning the effects of donor age on MSC regenerative potential. Several<italic> in vitro</italic> reports involving various species (rodents, monkeys, and humans) have indicated that aging is accompanied by many changes in biological processes affecting MSCs such as (i) a decline in the number of cells obtained by bone marrow aspiration, (ii) decrease in their proliferation and differentiation potential, (iii) decreased CFU frequency, (iv) increased senescent cell frequency, (v) lack of the characteristic spindle-like morphology observed in younger donors' MSCs, (vi) decrease in the expression of MSC surface markers, and (vii) miRNA expression and immunomodulatory potential [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>On the other hand, few recent<italic> in vivo</italic> studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic effectiveness of MSCs is dependent on the age of the donor. In acute myocardial infarction model rats, a more rapidly decreased survival rate of the old MSCs in the infarcted region was observed, which may be caused by the increased susceptibility of the cells to reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Another study into chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model demonstrated that donor age significantly affects the ability of human MSCs to provide neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and/or remyelination [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Also, it has been reported that the aging of human MSCs impairs angiogenic capacities in a mouse ischemic hindlimb model, since it has effects on their ability to differentiate towards endothelial cells, secretion of proangiogenic and prosurvival factors, and oxidative stress [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, insufficient information is available concerning the effects of donor age on MSC regenerative potential in cutaneous wound healing [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, we evaluate whether donor age influences MSC regenerative potential in cutaneous wound healing in a full thickness excisional wound model [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Every two days after MSC transplant, wound healing was macroscopically (wound closure) and microscopically assessed (reepithelialization, dermal-epidermal junction, skin appendage regeneration, granulation tissue formation, leukocyte infiltration, and density dermal collagen fibers) at 12 days after MSC transplant. The results suggest that the treatment with adult's BM-MSCs or their acd-MSCs in cutaneous wound promotes tissue repair/regeneration. The mechanisms involved in these beneficial effects were likely related to the ability of adult BM-MSCs to release paracrine factors in a regulated way, thereby modulating the wound healing response.</p>

        <p>The wound area was measured in duplicate with a digital calliper (Mitutoyo Sul Americana LTDA, Brazil) every two days after BM-MSCs from different ages or their acd-MSCs transplant and digital photographs were taken (FUJIFILM-Finepix HS20 EXR). The wound area was analyzed by the measure obtained with the digital caliper. Time elapsed to wound closure was defined as the time during which the wound bed became completely reepithelialized and filled with new tissue. The percentage of wound closure was calculated as follows: (area of original wound &#x2212; area of actual wound)/area of original wound &#xD7; 100. All wounds were repaired after 12 days and the mice were sacrificed; skin samples from the affected area and 2&#x2009;mm of the surrounding skin were harvested using an 8&#x2009;mm biopsy punch.</p>

        <p>Mice were sacrificed by an overdose of anesthesia (ketamine 50&#x2009;mg/kg-xylazine 5&#x2009;mg/kg (Centrovet)). The skin was rapidly removed, fixed in 10% formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Four <italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m thick skin sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and Masson's trichrome (Diagnostic Biosystems, Pleasanton, CA). Computational analysis was made to provide quantitative analysis regarding the dermoepidermal junction. In short, the analysis was made by manually tracing the border of area with incomplete junction and calculating pixel area using an image analysis program (NIH ImageJ). The size of the traced area was calculated automatically by the software. The graph represents the frequency (%) of animals with different scores. We gave the following scores.</p>
        <p>0: &gt;2,801 pixels per area, corresponding to injunction; I: 1,201&#x2013;2,800 pixels per area; II: 751&#x2013;1,200 pixels per area; III: 401&#x2013;750 pixels per area; and IV: 0.1&#x2013;400 pixels per area, corresponding to complete junction (Supplementary Figure&#x2009;&#x2009;1A in Supplementary Material available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/1461648">http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/1461648</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>We standardized histopathologic criteria in haematoxylin-eosin for determining the degree of leukocyte infiltration from &#x2212; to +++ (unquantifiable subjective parameters) (Supplementary Figure&#x2009;&#x2009;1B).</p>
        <p>Also, a quantification of granulation tissue was made by manually tracing the border of area of granulation tissue and calculating pixel area using an image analysis program (NIH ImageJ).

        <p>Appendage-like structures in each wound section were observed with Masson's trichrome staining.</p>
        <p>Morphometric computational analysis of dermal collagen was made in Masson's trichrome staining to provide quantitative analysis regarding the density and the intensity of dermal collagen fibers according to method described by Miot and Brianezi [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
        <p>Tissue sections of 4&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>m were evaluated by epidermal keratin subunits. The histological samples were permeabilized with TBS-Tween 0.1% (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and afterwards were blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Auckland, NZ). Keratinocytes were stained with a monoclonal antibody against epidermal keratin subunits (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) and visualized with a secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 647 (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). Cross-reactivity of the secondary antibody was tested without primary antibody. DAPI (4&#x2032;6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (AppliChem, Germany) was used for nuclear staining. All slides were examined under a Leica DM2000 microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) and images captured with a Leica DFC 295 camera (Wetzlar, Germany).</p>

        <p>In order to study the activity of BM-MSCs from different age donors on wound closure, two different doses of syngeneic BM-MSCs derived from different aged donor mice were injected into excisional wounds in C57BL/6 mice. There was accelerated wound closure with syngeneic BM-MSCs-treated wounds compared to vehicle-treated wounds (8 versus 12 days, resp.). Moreover, BM-MSCs-induced enhancement appeared early after 2 days and became more evident 4 days after cell injection, compared to vehicle. Furthermore, it was found that BM-MSCs obtained from adult donors were the most efficient tools for fastening wound closure (50% after 4 days for adult versus 6 for young and old); such difference was not improved by increasing the amount of cells.</p>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>Researchers have recently begun to collect data concerning the effects of natural aging on MSCs in their regenerative potential. The present work shows whether donor age modifies the regenerative potential of BM-MSCs on cutaneous wound healing model [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Previous studies in different animal models of regeneration such as partial hepatectomy [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], spinal cord injury [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and critical bone defect [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have suggested that the regenerative therapeutic effect of MSCs occurs early on in days following implant. Our findings corroborated the above, since enhanced wound closure kinetics was evident as early as two days after BM-MSCs administration from adult mouse donors, whilst this effect was less dramatic with their acd-MSCs and occurred later (day 6). These findings suggest that the effect of BM-MSCs might occur by, at least, two basic synergistically acting mechanisms and during different wound healing phases: (i) MSC transdifferentiation into epithelial cells [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and/or (ii) the secretion of paracrine factors stimulating local dermal fibroblast and keratinocyte migration, along with a contribution towards extracellular matrix and neovascularization formation and remodeling [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is still controversial whether MSCs can contribute significantly to regenerate damaged tissue via tissue specific transdifferentiation, since most studies have agreed that although MSCs can migrate<italic> in vivo</italic> to injury sites in response to chemotactic signals, only a small percentage of engrafted MSCs actually become incorporated and survive within damaged tissue, as it was shown by Wu et al. in an excisional wound model in normal and diabetic mice [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Other studies have revealed that transplanted MSCs do not necessarily have to be in close proximity to damaged tissue to promote wound repair and functional recovery. It was shown by Basiouny et al. that the effect of BM-MSCs on healing of induced full thickness skin wounds in albino rats using topical and systemic injections was effective with both methods of BM-MSCs injection; however, the topical method was more effective [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this context, recent and growing evidence indicates that the main MSC therapeutic action concerned in repairing skin disorders is by secretion of cytokines and growth factors that regulate local cellular response in cutaneous injury. This theory has been further reinforced by our findings and recent studies, which have shown that allogeneic and xenogeneic acd-MSCs have enhanced wound healing when administered locally into the wound from diabetic and nondiabetic mice and rats [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>Until now, most of the studies with MSCs in cutaneous wound healing agree that these cells can accelerate wound closure due to the increase of epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and neovascularization [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The foregoing facts could be due to MSCs secreting trophic factors such as EGF, KGF, IGF-1, and bFGF that are particularly related to increased dermal fibroblast migration and proliferation and stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. In our study, a qualitative improvement, such as superior rete ridge architecture, multilayered structure, and major dermoepidermal junction, was observed in the groups treated with both doses of BM-MSCs from different ages or their acd-MSCs rather than vehicle alone.</p>
      <p>MSCs also play an important role in healing the mesenchyme. This was confirmed by our data where increased formation of appendage-like structure (hair follicles or sebaceous glands) was observed in BM-MSCs from three ages or their acd-MSCs-treated groups. This potential benefit has been observed by other studies using BM-MSCs, human umbilical cord derived MSCs [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], or products derived of these cells such as exosomes [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or conditioned medium [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>Granulation tissue is a tissue of neoformation with reparative properties and it is a critical early step in healing [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We observed macroscopically higher granulation tissue formation on day 4 in the bed of BM-MSCs-treated wounds than wounds treated with acd-MSCs or vehicle alone (Supplementary Figure&#x2009;&#x2009;3). In addition, our histological assessment on day 12 showed higher granulation tissue formation in the groups treated with BM-MSCs from adult age or their acd-MSCs more than BM-MSCs from young and old age or vehicle alone. The granulation tissue type in groups treated with BM-MSCs or their acd-MSCs was in more mature stage development compared to group treated with vehicle where the granulation tissue was in an earlier phase with abundant proliferation fibroblastic type. This observation was consistent with one of the MSCs' therapeutic functions regarding wounds described to date where the early induction of granulation tissue followed by neovascular network leads to fast wounds healing [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
      <p>Greater leukocyte infiltration was found on day 12 after lesion in wounds receiving young and old BM-MSCs or their acd-MSCs or vehicle compared to adult BM-MSCs or their acd-MSCs. These results suggested that inappropriate cell source or insufficient growth factor delivery might contribute towards a chronic inflammatory state becoming established. Impaired cytokine production or immunological activity has been associated with age-related alterations [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>Wound nonhealing is associated with atypical matrix deposition that may be related to the overproduction or insufficient growth factors [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It was observed in our study that wounds receiving only vehicle compared to wounds treated with BM-MSCs from three different donor ages or their acd-MSCs had more density and optimum collagenous fiber organization at the dermal matrix compared.</p>
      <p>However, we show that BM-MSCs or their acd-MSCs contribute significantly to improve the parameters of the regenerated skin compared with wounds treated only with vehicle. Our data showed that regenerative potential of BM-MSCs or their acd-MSCs changed with donor age, where adult donors showed a higher accelerated kinetic closure and a better quality and healing regenerated skin. Nevertheless, these changes in the regenerative potential observed in the preclinical model did not have some clear relation with<italic> in vitro</italic> properties of BM-MSCs obtained from mouse donors of different age. Studies covering many species (rodents, monkeys, and humans) have indicated a correlation between age and declining CFU number [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; our observations presented here also demonstrate that this effect occurs. Nevertheless, the markers used in this study to identify BM-MSCs (CD45.2, CD11b, Sca-1, CD90, and ASMA) had stable expression during MSC aging, this being consistent with other studies where the phenotype did not change with donor age [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Some groups have observed a significant decrease in MSC growth rate regarding old donors [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; by contrast, others, such as Katsara et al., report that mouse BM-MSCs showed similar proliferation capacities<italic> in vitro</italic>, independent of age or sex, and retained their proliferative capacity for up to 5 months in culture [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similar observations were made by Bergman et al. who showed that the basal proliferative rate in cultures from older animals was more than three times larger than the observed one in cultures from young animals [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our study, we observed a rapid expansion of old donor BM-MSC; nevertheless, such change in proliferation potential was not statistically significant. Differences in cell morphology are often associated with senescence; some authors have reported that young donor MSCs have spindle type morphology in culture, whereas MSCs from older patients do not have them [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Nevertheless, this change was not observed in our cultures of BM-MSCs from each age group. There is conflicting data regarding the effect of aging on MSC potential to differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic, and other lineages; few studies have found no effect [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] but most of them suggest that aging reduces osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, whilst enhancing adipogenic potential [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We found that different aged donors' BM-MSCs preserved their ability regarding<italic> in vitro</italic> differentiation into osteogenic and adipogenic cells.</p>
      <p>Successful wound healing is particularly related to trophic factors such as EGF, KGF, VEGF, IGF-1, bFGF, PDGF-BB, ANG-1, SDF-1, and MMP9 or cytokines such as TGF-beta, IL-6, and IL-8 [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Recent studies have shown dramatic changes in the expression of genes in murine MSCs during aging, including those associated with growth factor and cytokines, such as VEGF, HGF, IGF-1, TGF-beta IL-6, and IL-8 [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our results in the difference of the gene expression levels from BM-MSCs of the three ages were similar to those reported by Wilson et al.'s study, where genes associated with growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, G-CSF, IGF, and EGF showed markedly lower levels of transcripts in old MSCs murine and rat [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This difference in gene expression levels may be due to the fact that old stem cells exhibit global suppression of RNA polymerase II serine-2 phosphorylation, which triggers productive transcription elongation, mRNA processing, and release of mature mRNA [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the difference in gene expression levels found here partly could give an explanation to the differences observed in the regenerative potential in wound healing, due to the fact that mRNA levels from adult BM-MSCs were not the lowest observed in BM-MSCs from three age groups of donors.</p>
      <p>In order to provide evidence if the changes in the regenerative potential observed<italic> in vivo</italic> have some relation with paracrine profile, we compared the level of secretion of growth factors and specific proteins in acd-MSCs derived from young, adult, and old mice cultured under standard conditions. We observed significant difference in five of the ten growth factors analyzed. The acd-MSCs from old BM-MSCs had higher secretion levels of VEGF, ANG-II, KGF, HGF, and MMP-1 than the acd-MSCs from young and adult BM-MSCs. Contradictory results had been observed from other groups where MSCs young and old rats cultured had no significant difference in either cell type [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Moreover, in the study by Jiang et al., secretion of VEGF was significantly higher in young MSCs than in old MSCs [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The inconsistency with these results could be due to the source of acd-MSCs or the time window of supernatant collection.</p>
      <p>Regarding whether different paracrine capacity of BM-MSCs from young, adult, and old donors can explain the observed differences on regenerative potential, we suggest that it is possible because it is well known that the success of the wound healing process depends on a regulated secretion of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines involved in a complex integration of signals that coordinate cellular processes [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Wound nonhealing has been related to the overproduction (acute wound) or insufficient (chronic wounds) growth factors and cytokines such as EGF, FGF-2, TGF-beta, PDGF, VEGF, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In this context we observed that the levels of secreted growth factors and specific proteins from adult BM-MSCs were not as low as they were from young BM-MSCs or as high as from old BM-MSCs. This observation could be indicative of a regulation of secretion of the growth factors and specific proteins analyzed, which are key in the wound healing process.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Our data show that MSC efficacy was negatively affected by donor age and that this fact might have been because of changes in their paracrine factor expression. So, increased BM-MSCs age should therefore be considered as a risk regarding the effectiveness of any therapeutic application of BM-MSCs or their acd-MSCs, especially concerning autologous cell therapy for elderly patients.</p>

          <p>Supplementary Figure 1: We standardized histological criteria in haematoxylin-eosin to provide quantitative analysis regarding the dermoepidermal junction and degree of leukocyte infiltration.</p>
          <p>Supplementary Figure 2: We evaluate reepithelialization with an epithelial tissue marker (pan-cytokeratin). We found expression in all groups.</p>
          <p>Supplementary Figure 3: We evaluate granulation tissue that is a tissue of neoformation with reparative properties. We observed macroscopically higher granulation tissue formation on day 4 in the bed of BM-MSCs-treated wounds than wounds treated with acd-MSCs or vehicle alone.</p>
          <p>Supplementary Table 1: Statistical data of flow cytometry showed that no significant age-related changes in the marker expression levels between the three age groups.</p>
