        <p>Human amniotic membrane extracts contain numerous growth factors and bioactive substances. However, osteogenic effects of amnion and chorion membrane extracts (AME and CME, respectively) on osteoblasts are unclear. In this study, we explored the ability of AME and CME to promote the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. MG-63 cells were cultured in osteogenic induction medium (OIM) with or without exogenous AME and CME. CME enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells compared with AME, as indicated by increased mineralization; alkaline phosphatase activity; and mRNA expression of osteogenic marker genes encoding integrin-binding sialoprotein (<italic>IBSP)</italic>, <italic>RUNX2</italic>, <italic>OSTERIX</italic>, and osteocalcin (<italic>OCN)</italic>. Interestingly, AME and CME contained different combinations of osteogenesis-related growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF&#x3B2;-1), and epidermal growth factor (EGF), which differentially regulated the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells. bFGF and TGF&#x3B2;-1 present in CME positively regulated the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells, whereas EGF present in AME negatively regulated the differentiation of MG-63 cells. Moreover, exogenous treatment of EGF antagonized CME-induced mineralization of extracellular matrix on MG-63 cells. We compared the osteogenic efficacy of CME with that of BMP2, bFGF, and TGF&#x3B2;-1 alone or their combinations. We observed that CME greatly enhanced osteogenesis by providing a conductive environment for the differentiation of MG-63 cells. Together, our results indicated that human AME and CME exerted differential effects on osteogenesis because of the presence of different compositions of growth factors. In addition, our results highlighted a new possible strategy of using CME as a biocompatible therapeutic material for bone regeneration.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Osteogenesis is a sequential process involving the proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic cells, activation of osteogenesis-specific genes, and maturation and mineralization of extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During bone formation, osteoblasts, the major bone-forming cells, synthesize bone matrix proteins, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN), and type I collagen, and subsequently produce a calcium- and phosphate-based mineral that is deposited into the ECM to form a strong, mineralized tissue [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Osteoblast differentiation is tightly controlled by specific extracellular regulatory proteins such as growth factors, hormones, vitamins, and cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Growth factors and cytokines modulate cell fate, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. Particularly, growth factors play an important role in bone regeneration and remodeling and several growth factors have been used in clinical therapies for treating bone defects[<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], However, use of growth factors in clinical therapies is impeded by problems such as low yield of recombinant growth factors and poor efficacy and stability [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>The human amniotic sac is derived from the placenta, which is composed of conjoined amnion (inner) and chorion (outer) membranes (AM and CM, respectively). In addition to its unique properties, the human amniotic sac contains numerous growth factors and cytokines, indicating that it is an ideal biomaterial for various therapeutic applications, including wound healing. Further, use of the human amniotic membrane in clinical therapy is associated with minimum inflammation, angiogenesis, and microbial infection [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We previously demonstrated the potential of human amniotic membrane extracts to promote the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, the extracts prepared from amnion/chorion membrane have showed greater effect on osteogenesis of MG-63 cells than the extracts from a single layer of the amnion membrane. This may be because of the different growth factors present in AM and CM.</p>
      <p>Important regulatory growth factors involved in osteogenesis include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP2 and BMP4), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF&#x3B2;-1), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, Rui-Dong and Li showed that the combination of BMP9 and TGF&#x3B2;-1 promoted the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, suggesting that these growth factors exerted a synergistic effect on osteogenesis in a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This finding also suggested that a crosstalk between BMP9 and TGF&#x3B2;-1 signaling pathways promoted osteogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, several studies have indicated that many osteogenesis-related growth factors, which are inter-connected, temporally participate in the regulation of osteogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Based on these findings, we hypothesized that AME and CME contain different compositions of growth factors, which may affect the overall osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells. Thus, the present study (1) investigated whether AME and CME exerted differential effects on osteogenesis, (2) analyzed the composition of osteogenesis-related growth factors in human AME and CME, and (3) determined the role of these growth factors in the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells.</p>

Written informed consent was obtained from each donor after explaining the purpose of this study.</p>
        <p>To prepare AME and CME, AM was separated from amniotic membrane tissue. The remaining tissue was used as CM. AM and CM were washed 3 times with PBS containing antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL streptomycin) to remove blood clots, were sliced into small pieces, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and finely ground by using a mortar and pestle. The ground membranes were mixed with PBS at 1:1 ratio of weight (g):volume (mL), were homogenized on ice for 1 h, and were centrifuged. After centrifugation, supernatants were filtered through a 0.22-&#x3BC;m pore size membrane. Concentrations of proteins in the supernatants were determined by performing DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and the supernatants were stored at -80&#xB0;C until further use.</p>

        <title>Exogenous AME or CME alter the morphology of MG-63 cells during osteogenesis</title>
        <p>Our previous studies suggested the potential ability of human amniotic membrane extracts on osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, it was unclear which membrane stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts between AM and CM. Therefore, we separated AM and CM and prepared 2 extracts (AME and CME) in the present study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182716.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). To evaluate osteogenesis-related morphological changes induced by AME or CME, we cultured human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells in OIM and treated them with AME or CME in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, treatment with AME or CME induced differential morphological changes in MG-63 cells compared with those in untreated cells cultured in only growth medium (GM) or only OIM for 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, right square images). While cells cultured in only OIM showed initiation of osteogenic differentiation compared with cells cultured in only GM, cells cultured in OIM containing CME showed more obvious evidence of osteogenesis than only OIM condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left square image). However, no detectable evidence of mineralized nodule formation was observed in cells cultured in OIM containing AME; however, these cells showed excessive cell migration and accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left square image).</p>

        <title>Potential of CME for promoting osteogenic differentiation</title>
        <p>Next, we examined whether AME and CME differentially promoted the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells. To measure ALP activity, MG-63 cells were cultured in OIM with or without AME, ACME (amnion/chorion membrane extracts) or CME for 3 or 7 days, respectively. On day 7, ALP activity was slightly different in cells treated with AME, ACME and CME at the concentration of 100 &#x3BC;g/mL compared with that in cells cultured in only OIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) while a much higher concentration (200 and 400 &#x3BC;g/mL) was clearly determine the significantly higher effect of CME on ALP activity than AME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In addition, CME has potential ability for promoting osteogenic differentiation when we compared the result of AME and ACME. Calcium concentration also significantly increased by approximately 25 folds in cells treated with 800 &#x3BC;g/mL CME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, calcium concentration in cells treated with the same concentration of AME was only 2- to 3-fold higher than that in cells cultured in only OIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). CME treatment also significantly upregulated the expression of osteogenic marker genes encoding <italic>RUNX2</italic> (8.939 fold), <italic>OSTERIX</italic> (1.607 fold), and <italic>IBSP</italic> (6.101 fold, <italic>p =</italic> 0.0292) on day 7 and the gene encoding <italic>OCN</italic> (3.907 fold, <italic>p =</italic> 0.0053) on day 24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Although AME treatment upregulated the expression of these osteogenic marker genes, the upregulation was not significant. Alizarin red S staining showed a strong increase in the mineralization of MG-63 cells treated with 400 &#x3BC;g/mL CME compared with that of cells cultured in only OIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).

Decellularization involves the removal of epithelial cells from the surface of AM by physiological or chemical methods to eliminate immunogenicity [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Koizumi et al. reported that the most growth factors present on the epithelium of AM are lost during decellularization [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although human CM contains more growth factors and cytokines than those present on an equal surface area of AM, CM has not been used as a scaffold because it is structurally difficult to operate during decellularization compared with AM. In this study we prepared human amniotic membrane matrix-extract and evaluated the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast-like cells. The AM matrix-extract is easy to use and storage in clinical setting and the procedure mentioned in this study did not affect the growth factors present in intact amnion and chorion membranes. Moreover, we also evaluated the less studies human CM extract&#x2019;s effect on the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts.</p>
      <p>Bone regeneration is a multistep process characterized by cell migration, coupling, proliferation and differentiation and involves several cells types such as osteoblasts, osteoclasts, endothelial cells and pericytes [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. BMPs are the most investigated growth factors involved in bone regeneration. BMPs diversely affect osteoblast lineage cells and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors, preosteoblasts, and osteoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Particularly, BMP2 recruits bone-lining cells at defected regions and enhances their differentiation by modulating angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Since its FDA approval in 2002, recombinant human BMP2 (rhBMP2) has been used for treating patients with various bone defects [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interestingly, CME did not contain BMP2, as determined by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g004">Fig 4</xref>). However, osteogenic effect of CME showed more promising results than BMP2 in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Treatment with 200&#x2013;400 &#x3BC;g/mL CME might provide an appropriate environment for the differentiation of MG-63 cells, which reached the late stage of osteogenesis on day 7 and 9 after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These results indicate that CME constituents promote the osteogenesis of MG-63 cells. A further study is needed to identify the exact component.</p>
      <p>With BMP2, growth factors such as bFGF, TGF&#x3B2;-1 and EGF play important roles in bone regeneration by promoting osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. In our study, treatment with high BMP2 doses induced ECM mineralization after 18 days; however, the combination of BMP2 + FGF2 + TGF&#x3B2;-1 did not promote the late-stage differentiation of MG-63 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g009">Fig 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182716.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). However, Alizarin red S staining demonstrated the significant efficacy of CME in promoting the mineralization of MG-63 cells compared with that of growth factors alone and/or their combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g009">Fig 9</xref>). These results indicated that CME possess potential for bone formation even in the absence of BMP2. In addition, interplay among different growth factors may influence stimulatory or inhibitory effects of osteoblasts which may differ among the combination and ratio of growth factors.</p>
      <p>In previous study, we optimized the in vitro dose of BMP2 as 500 ng/mL for enhancing osteogenesis on MG-63 cells at 20 days after the treatment in OIM. Therefore, here we used 500 ng/mL BMP2 as the highest concentration in single growth factor treatment for increasing mineralized nodule formation on MG-63 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Previous studies reported much lower concentration of growth factors for in vitro osteogenic differentiation on human and mouse MSCs [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The optimum dosage of growth factors for in vitro osteogenesis may vary by the cell type used in the experimental system. For example, in our study lower concentration of bFGF have shown an increased ALP activity hMSCs at day 7, however, no effect on MG-63 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The reason could be the different ability of cells as an osteoblast on in vitro osteogenic differentiation. In addition, the promoting effect of growth factors on osteogenesis may differ by the period of in vitro ostoegenesis. Many studies commonly used low growth factor doses and long culture period for in vitro differentiation of osteoblasts. Here, in order to detect the stimulatory effect of CME on osteogenesis during short differentiation period, we treated high concentration of growth factors and compared the efficacy of osteogenesis. Our results showed that CME significantly promoted mineralization and calcium accumulation only at 7 and 9 days after osteogenic induction while high doses of growth factors could not enhance the osteogenesis of MG 63 cells. Therefore, the potential ability of CME for osteogenesis was much better than several bone-specific growth factors, even if high concentration of growth factors were used under the same experimental condition and period.</p>
      <p>Growth factors are known to be involved in proliferation and differentiation of osteo-progenitor cells. Previous data showed that osteogenesis of rat MSCs was promoted by adding bFGF in the earlier stages followed by the treatment of BMP2 at the later stage [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. They determined the temporal and synergistic effect of bFGF and BMP2 on osteogenesis and explained the reason; the treatment of bFGF at the early stage increased the total number of cells, which may also increase the BMP2 receptors on the cell surfaces to enhance the binding potential with added BMP2 at the late stage. In this study, our main focus was to study the differentiation effects of growth factors on osteogenesis of MG-63 cells, rather than the proliferation effects. We constantly applied growth factors to study the osteogenic effects on MG63 cells and compared with CME. The temporal and multiple combination of growth factors for osteogenesis will consider in our future experiments. Furthermore, the optimal time for growth factor addition and dosages during osteogenesis further needs to study to understand the natural spatiotemporal process of bone regeneration. Altogether, our results showed that CME is a complete natural solution that is easier to apply to enhance osteogenesis than selectively addition of bone-specific growth factors during differentiation of osteoblasts.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have suggested that continuous treatment with rhBMP2 leads to adverse such as carcinogenesis and excessive bone regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182716.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, CME might be an excellent alternative to BMP2 for bone regeneration because it is easy to obtain, is more safe and biocompatible for <italic>in vivo</italic> application, and promote the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts.</p>
      <p>The bFGF has biological activities including proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and bone differentiation. However, the osteogenic effects of bFGF on osteoblasts are controversial. Dombrowski et al. have shown that blocking of FGF signaling using the chemical inhibitor SU5402 increases mineralization of rat bone marrow stem cells (rMSCs) in OIM for 21 days [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, we cultured MG-63 cells in OIM with SU5402 for only 9 days. No detectable change of mineralization was observed during 9 days on MG-63 cells cultured in OIM containing SU5402 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182716.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Collectively, it implies that FGF signaling does not affect osteogenic differentiation at the early stage of osteogenesis whereas this specific signaling has negative effect on the late stage of osteogenic differentiation, suggesting the continuous activation of FGF signaling may be unnecessary for osteogenic differentiation in <italic>in vitro</italic> system. In addition, a new fining recently supported by Kim et al., identified DJ-1 protein which is a novel osteogenic factor to promote the osteogenesis of MSCs through the activation of FGF signaling [<xref rid="pone.0182716.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We have shown the inhibitory effect of SU5402 on the osteogenic differentiation of CME-treated MG-63 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g005">Fig 5</xref>), indicating that CME may contain an osteogenic stimulator to enhance mineralization of osteoblast-like cells via FGF signaling like DJ-1.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we evaluated the effects of CME on the differentiation of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells and hMSCs. The effect of CME on other bone lineage cells and different types of osteoblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> needs to be evaluated along with the mechanism underlying the stimulation of osteogenesis by CME.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Both AME and CME enhanced the osteogenesis of MG-63 cells; however, CME was more effective in promoting osteogenesis than AME. We found that bFGF and TGF&#x3B2;-1 present in both the extracts positively regulated the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells while EGF present in AME negatively regulated the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Based on their growth factor composition, AME and CME exerted differential effects on the expression of osteogenic marker genes, which in turn affected the mineralization of MG-63 cells during osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182716.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Moreover, our results clearly indicated the excellent capacity of CME in promoting bone regeneration compared with that bFGF, TGF&#x3B2;-1, and BMP2 alone or in combination. Therefore, we suggest two possible translational approaches to various bone disease such as osteoporosis and osteopetrosis. The first strategy is a combination treatment of CME with stem cells which may use in bone defect to promote bone growth and healing. On the other hand, AME may provide a new therapeutic strategy to modulate the bone density or calcification during bone regeneration by modifying osteogenic efficacy of AME using EGFR inhibitors.</p>

          <title>Proposed mechanisms underlying the effect of growth factors present in AME and CME on the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells.</title>
          <p>(A) Of the several growth factors present in CME, bFGF and TGF&#x3B2;-1 positively regulated the expression of osteogenic marker genes, which subsequently promoted ECM mineralization during the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells. (B) AME contained high concentrations of EGF along with bFGF and TGF&#x3B2;-1. bFGF and TGF&#x3B2;-1 upregulated the expression of osteogenic marker genes, which positively affect to the formation of mineralization, like CME. In contrast, activation of EGF signaling in AME-treated MG-63 cells decreased the expression of osteogenic marker genes, thus preventing these cells from entering the late stage of osteogenic differentiation, which is characterized by ECM mineralization.</p>

      <p>The exact regulatory mechanisms underlying the mineralization of osteoblasts induced by growth factors and proteins in the human amniotic membrane are unclear. However, our findings clearly indicate the potential of CME in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast-like cells and human bone marrow derived MSCs, suggesting that it can be used as a novel therapeutic biomaterial for bone regeneration.</p>
