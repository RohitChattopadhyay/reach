      <abstract>
        <p>Pancreatic stem cells were isolated and cultured from aborted human fetal pancreases of gestational age 14&#x2013;20 weeks. They were seeded at a density of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>4</sup> in serum-free media for differentiation into neuron-like cells, expressing &#x3B2;-tubulin III and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These neuron-like cells displayed a synapse-like morphology and appeared to form a neuronal network. Pancreatic stem cells were also seeded at a density of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> for differentiation into islet-like cells, expressing insulin and glucagon, with an islet-like morphology. These cells had glucose-stimulated secretion of human insulin and C-peptide. Results suggest that pancreatic stem cells can be differentiated into neuron-like and islet-like cells.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>During embryogenesis, the pancreatic and nervous systems develop from the endodermal and ectodermal layers, respectively[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite different embryologic origins, pancreatic and neural cells express numerous common enzymes and markers, as well as sharing some developmental control mechanisms[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pancreatic stem cells (PSCs) can be differentiated into insulin expressing cells that recover hyperglycemia in diabetic animals[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They can also differentiate into neural cells that can be used to treat diabetic neuropathy[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, the fetal pancreas has been hypothesized to possess an extensive regeneration capacity compared with that of the adult pancreas. Thus, we decided to study the pluripotency of PSCs from fetal pancreases that were not fully mature, to determine if they can differentiate into pancreatic islet and neural cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

        <p>Freshly isolated islet cells were cultured in modified high-glucose Dulbecco&#x2019;s modified Eagle&#x2019;s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 hours, scattered adherent epidermal-like cells were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and a large number of non-adherent cells were removed by a complete medium change. Culture medium was then replaced with DMEM-F12 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells reached 80% confluence after 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and proliferation was significantly enhanced by medium supplementation with 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), with cells reaching 80% confluence in 5&#x2013;6 days. Epidermal-like cells were established with serial passaging and PSCs were similar to the primary stem cells after some passages. Furthermore, primary PSCs were identified by a noticeable expression of nestin by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and weak expression of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox (PDX)-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). This expression pattern indicated that stable self-renewable stem cells were established. After differentiation, neurons and neuroglial structures were generated, as well as mature round pancreatic islet cells. This indicated that the isolated PSCs were multipotent.</p>

        <p>There were no significant changes in PSC morphology during the first 3 days following EGF, insulin-transferrin-selenium-A, and glutamine treatment. In serum-free culture, PSC morphology gradually changed from fusiform-like to irregular polygon shapes, with bipolar and multi-polar cells, as well as synaptic-like structures and neural reticular formations similar to neuron and neuroglial morphologies. Occasionally, neural filament-like structures or large neuronal networks were also observed. The spontaneous differentiation rate of neural-like cells was 2&#x2013;5% (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">F</xref>).</p>

        <p>PSC differentiation into insulin-producing cells was performed by a two-stage protocol. During stage 1, cells decreased in size and became stretched with retraction. These spindle-like cells shortened and became semi-attached round epithelial-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). During stage 2, cells became round and increasing islet-like clusters were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). By day 9 of differentiation, cells had detached and grew in suspension. Ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy showed that differentiated cells contained small secretory granules, which are a characteristic of pancreatic endocrine cells.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this study, we used human fetal pancreases rather than heterogeneous islets or islet-depleted fractions used by other studies[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Immature fetal pancreases, expressing PDX-1, CK19, nestin and other markers of regenerating and developing pancreas, possess excellent regenerative, proliferative, and differentiation abilities compared with those of the mature adult pancreas[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The EGF receptor is also expressed throughout the human fetal pancreas, and mice lacking EGF receptor develop abnormal pancreatic islets[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This study has shown that human fetal PSCs actively proliferate in serum-free medium supplemented with EGF and bFGF. PSCs were seeded at a high density for the formation of a three-dimensional cell structure, expressing insulin and glucagon. Upon glucose stimulation, these cells secreted C-peptide and insulin at similar quantities compared with those of native islets. PSCs were seeded at a low density for differentiation into neuron-like cells, expressing &#x3B2;-tubulin III and glial fibrillary acidic protein. We also observed that final C-peptide and insulin concentrations of stage 2 cultures varied by 2&#x2013;4-fold. This may be due to cell-type variability and unequal proliferation/differentiation capacities. Thus, small variations in the initial composition of PSCs would translate into significant differences among differentiated cells. Our results suggest that high concentrations of EGF promote PSC differentiation into islet-like clusters. A previous study demonstrated that EGF is an important growth factor for the proliferation of various cell types, particularly fibroblasts and epithelial cells[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Combinatorial therapy with EGF and gastrin has also been shown to result in &#x3B2;-cell regeneration in rodents with chemically induced diabetes[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>In summary, in this study, we used human fetal immature pancreases to examine the multipotent differentiation characteristics of pancreatic-derived stem cells. Under different differentiation conditions, PSCs were separately induced into neuron and islet-like cells. Serum-free and low-density cell culture contributes toward neural cell differentiation, while high-density cell culture is biased toward islet cell differentiation. This study may provide a new insight into potential sources of cells for therapeutic transplantation for diabetes and its related chronic neuropathy complications.</p>

Subsequently, cells slowly proliferated in serum-free medium and reached 80% confluence after 10 days. Cell proliferation was significantly enhanced by supplementing 10 ng/mL EGF (Invitrogen) and 10 ng/mL bFGF (Invitrogen) into culture medium, resulting in cells reaching 80% confluence after 5&#x2013;6 days.

Stage 1 (pre-differentiation): PSCs were cultured in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL bFGF, 10 ng/mL EGF, 1 &#xD7; B27 and 2 mM glutamine for 3 days; Stage 2 (insulin-secreting cell maturation): differentiated cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 20 mM nicotinamide, 1 &#xD7; B27 and 2 mM glutamine for 6 days. An increase in EGF concentration from 10 to 500 ng/mL during pre-differentiation induced the formation of islet-like clusters.</p>

          <p>Approximately 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>3</sup> PSCs or cells from each differentiation stage were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 20 minutes at room temperature and incubated at 4&#xB0;C overnight with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used and their dilutions were as follows: mouse anti-human nestin monoclonal antibody (1:200; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA); rabbit anti-PDX-1 polyclonal antibody (1:500; Chemicon); mouse anti-human insulin monoclonal antibody (1:100; R&amp;D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA); rabbit anti-glucagon polyclonal antibody (1:250; Chemicon); rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein polyclonal antibody (1:100; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA); mouse anti-human microtubule-associated protein-2 monoclonal antibody (1:100; Sigma); mouse anti-human myelin basic protein monoclonal antibody (1:50; Sigma); and mouse anti-human &#x3B2;-tubulin III monoclonal antibody (1:100; Sigma). Labeled-cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 1 hour with diluted fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies as follows: goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:100; Sigma); and sheep anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 (1:60; Sigma). Following this, cells were counter-stained with 4&#x2019;, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (2 &#x3BC;g/mL; Sigma) for 30 minutes. Cells were visualized and photographed with a confocal microscope (MPS60, Leica, Solms, Germany). Immunostaining was performed with secondary antibodies alone as negative controls.</p>

          <title>Islet-like cell structure identification by dithizone staining</title>
          <p>After inducing PSCs to differentiate into islet-like cells for 9 days, the cells were harvested with culture medium in 1.5 mL tubes, centrifuged, washed with PBS and placed in 35 mm Petri dishes for dithizone staining (Sigma). Routine staining was performed by adding 10 &#x3BC;L dithizone stock to islet cells suspended in 1 mL Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 1 hour, following which they were observed using an inverted microscope.</p>

          <p>Insulin and C-peptide release assays[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were performed in 0.5 mL serum-free DMEM and incubated for 1 hour. An electrochemiluminescence immunoassay[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was used to measure the release of intracellular insulin and C-peptide into the medium in response to various glucose concentrations and to measure cellular insulin concentration after ultrasonic cell lysis, using an Elecsys 1010 insulin and C-peptide kit (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). To test whether insulin and C-peptide released from PSC-differentiated endocrine cells was glucose-dependent, three glucose concentrations (5.5, 16.7, and 25 mM) were used for stimulation. Pre-differentiated PSCs treated with the same conditions were used as a control.</p>
