      <abstract>
        <p>Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is involved in gene regulation and development; however, its precise function, molecular targets and underlying mechanisms during development are poorly understood. Here we show that LSD1 is required for neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) maintenance during cortical development. A ChIP-seq analysis identified a LSD1-binding site (LBAL) downstream of <italic>Atrophin1</italic> (<italic>ATN1</italic>). Surprisingly, tranylcypromine (LSD1 inhibitor) treatment increased H3K4 methylation at LBAL, leading to <italic>ATN1</italic> repression and NPC differentiation. Knockdown of LSD1 and ATN1 phenocopied each other in inducing NPC premature differentiation and depletion, which could be rescued by ATN1 overexpression, suggesting that LSD1 controls NPC differentiation via regulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> methylation status and expression. The involvement of LSD1 in ATN1 expression and NPC maintenance were confirmed in knockout mice. These findings hint at the potential application for the clinical drug, tranylcypromine, in the prevention and/or treatment of <italic>ATN1</italic>-associated degenerative disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays a critical role in many biological processes, including cell reprogramming, development, tumorigenesis and ageing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Histone methylation is one type of epigenetic modification which, when perturbed, leads to various diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
    <p>The development of the mammalian neocortex requires a balance between self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitor/precursor cells (NPCs, predominantly radial glial cells) followed by neuronal migration and maturation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), a histone demethylase for mono- or dimethylated H3K4 and H3K9 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), has been indicated in different aspects of brain development, including pituitary development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, cortical neuron migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and adult NPC proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. LSD1 is also required for embryonic stem cell differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In addition, LSD1 was recently identified as a target of the microRNA miR-137; overexpression of miR-137 induced premature differentiation and migration of immature neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Thus, although this implicates that LSD1 may be involved in coordinating NPC proliferation versus differentiation, detailed information on its molecular targets and mechanisms of action is still lacking.</p>
    <p>Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant neuronal degenerative disease characterized by ataxia, choreoathetosis and cognitive dysfunction, including dementia, resulting from polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in <italic>Atrophin1</italic> (<italic>ATN1</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. ATN1 interacts with, and modulates the activity of, the transcriptional repressor TLX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. <italic>ATN1</italic> knockout mice are viable<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, but the function of ATN1 in brain development has not yet been examined.</p>
    <p>The present study investigated the role of LSD1 in the neocortex to determine whether epigenetic changes in gene expression during embryonic development affect progenitor cell maintenance. We provided evidence here that <italic>ANT1</italic> is a direct target of LSD1 and that knockdown or knockout of LSD1 leads to the downregulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression. Knockdown of either LSD1 or ATN1 induces significant premature differentiation and depletion of NPCs, and it can be rescued by <italic>ATN1</italic> expression. Moreover, the clinical LSD1 inhibitor, tranylcypromine, suppressed <italic>ATN1</italic> expression, suggesting that it could be applied to the treatment of adult-onset DRPLA.</p>

        <title>LSD1 depletion results in premature NPC differentiation</title>
        <p>The expression of LSD1 in the developing rat brain was first examined. LSD1 immunoreactivity was observed in the nucleus in all layers of the cortex, including the proliferative ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ and SVZ, respectively), the intermediate zone (IZ) through which newly born neurons migrate and the nascent cortical plate (CP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Two short hairpin RNA (shRNA)/DsRed constructs were found to be highly efficient in knocking down both overexpressed and endogenous LSD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3g</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). These shRNA constructs were electroporated into rat cortex via <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUE) at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) and the brains were examined 4 days later (E20.5). In control embryos transfected with a control shRNA/DsRed construct, DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells were distributed in all the layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In contrast, on LSD1 knockdown most of the transfected cells were found in the IZ, with very few in the CP, consistent with a previous report that LSD1 depletion inhibits neuronal migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, much fewer cells were observed in the VZ and SVZ compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Cortical neurons arise on a chronological schedule with subtypes of neurons emerging in a defined order<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>; therefore, we performed the IUE experiment from E15.5 to E18.5 similar to what we did previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Similar results of NPC depletion were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>), indicating that LSD1 may regulate NPC development at different stages.</p>
        <p>We examined whether the loss of NPC induced by LSD1 knockdown is due to increased cell death, by staining the brain sections with the activated form of caspase 3, and found no apparent increase of cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). In addition, co-transfection of a shRNA-resistant LSD1 construct rescued the depletion of NPCs in the VZ and SVZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a&#x2013;c</xref>), thereby excluding the possibility of shRNA off-target effects.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the depletion of transfected cells in the proliferative zones corresponded to cell fate changes, cells transfected with LSD1 shRNA/DsRed from E15.5 to 18.5 were examined for the expression of the progenitor markers Sox2 and Tbr2&#x2014;which label apical progenitors/radial glial cells of the VZ and intermediate/basal progenitors of the SVZ, respectively&#x2014;as well as the early neuronal marker Tuj1. LSD1 knockdown resulted in substantial decrease of Sox2<sup>+</sup> and Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells, and a corresponding increase of Tuj1<sup>+</sup> cells, and these could be rescued by co-expression of human LSD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). These results indicate that the loss of LSD1 in NPCs induces their premature differentiation into neurons.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the observed effect was due to the demethylase activity of LSD1, cortical progenitor cells dissociated at E16.5 were treated with the LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and examined 24&#x2009;h later by staining cells with the progenitor cell marker Nestin and the differentiation marker Tuj1. Inhibition of LSD1 activity induced the differentiation of NPCs, as indicated by the significantly increased number of Tuj1<sup>+</sup> cells and concomitant decrease in Nestin<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further confirm the role of LSD1 in neuronal differentiation, <italic>LSD1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mice were crossed with Nestin-<italic>Cre</italic> mice to generate the <italic>LSD1</italic> brain-specific conditional knockout (<italic>LSD1</italic> cKO) mice. Loss of LSD1 expression in cKO mouse brains was verified by immunostaining and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). cKO mice have smaller brains and thinner cortices compared with their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). E15.5 wild-type or <italic>LSD1</italic> cKO mice were then injected with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and analysed 24&#x2009;h later. Similar to that of LSD1 knockdown, BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the VZ were depleted in the <italic>LSD1</italic> cKO brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), with most BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells localized in the SVZ and much less cells reaching the IZ, in contrast to their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). More importantly, the fraction of Ki67<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells increased significantly in the <italic>LSD1</italic> cKO brains, indicating that more <italic>LSD1</italic> cKO cells underwent cell cycle exit and premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). Probably due to the premature differentiation, the number of cells incorporated with BrdU decreased substantially in <italic>LSD1</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). We also dissected NPCs from E14.5 mice, cultured for 48&#x2009;h and examined the Nestin and Tuj1 markers. Similar to LSD1 inhibitor treatment, knockout of <italic>LSD1</italic> induced differentiation of NPCs, as revealed by the reduction of Nestin<sup>+</sup> cells and increase of Tuj1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d,e</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that LSD1 is required for the maintenance of NPCs during cortical development.</p>

        <title>LSD1 positively regulates <italic>ATN1</italic> expression</title>
        <p>To further investigate the mechanism by which LSD1 maintains the progenitor pool, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed in E16.5 brain homogenates to identify potential targets of LSD1. Genes encoding histones were the most highly represented among the potential targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), consistent with previous reports and the known function of LSD1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). A novel candidate gene was <italic>ATN1</italic>. Interestingly, the analysis revealed a putative LSD1-binding site downstream of the <italic>ATN1</italic> coding region, as opposed to within the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). A homology search indicated that this sequence, which was named LBAL (LSD1-binding site at the <italic>ATN1</italic> locus), is conserved in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Intriguingly, ChIP-seq results by a previous report indicate that the binding site of the SET1/MLL histone methyltransferase complex subunit, Dpy-30, overlaps with LBAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The binding of LSD1 and K4-dimethylated histone H3 (dimethyl H3K4) to LBAL was confirmed by ChIP&#x2013;quantitative PCR (qPCR), which showed enrichment by 3.3- and 23.8-fold, respectively, relative to the IgG control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In addition, treatment of cultured cortical progenitors for 8&#x2009;h with tranylcypromine increased the levels of both dimethyl and monomethyl H3K4 at LBAL without apparently altering the H3K9 monomethylation at LBAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting that the demethylase activity of LSD1 is normally required to suppress H3K4 methylation at this site. Moreover, both messenger RNA and protein expression of <italic>ATN1</italic> was suppressed by tranylcypromine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e,f</xref>), corresponding to the observed premature differentiation of NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Although the dimethyl (not monomethyl) H3K9 level at LBAL was also enhanced by tranylcypromine treatment, much less histone methylation modification occurred in H3K9 than in H3K4, suggesting that LBAL site is mostly occupied and regulated by H3K4 methylation modification and not H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm that LSD1 regulated <italic>ATN1</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, rat brains were electroporated with shLSD1 at E16.5, and 3 days later those DsRED<sup>+</sup> cells were collected through fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Consistently, the qPCR results showed the efficient knockdown of <italic>LSD1</italic> by shLSD1 and significant downregulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). This was also confirmed by immunostaining of those cells transfected with shLSD1 in the VZ with both LSD1 and ATN1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>). More importantly, we detected significantly lower ATN1 protein levels in E14.5 cortices of brain-specific <italic>LSD1</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Decreased <italic>ATN1</italic> expression was also confirmed in the NPCs residing in the VZ of <italic>LSD1</italic> cKO mice cortex by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c,d</xref>). All these <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results demonstrate that <italic>ATN1</italic> expression is positively regulated by LSD1. This finding was unexpected, as H3K4 dimethylation is typically associated with transcriptional activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>; thus, LSD1 demethylase activity would be predicted to suppress <italic>ATN1</italic> expression, while tranylcypromine treatment or LSD1 knockout should have the opposite effect.</p>
        <p>Given that LSD1 binds to the LBAL site downstream of <italic>ATN1</italic> locus and positively regulates <italic>ATN1</italic> expression, we investigated whether the regulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression by LSD1 is through LBAL. The LBAL sequence (1.98&#x2009;kb) was cloned upstream of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter in the pCMS-eGFP backbone (pCMS-eGFP-LBAL), becoming a downstream insertion on vector linearization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 7a and 4</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of the LBAL downstream of GFP dramatically enhanced the expression of GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). Tranylcypromine treatment substantially suppressed GFP expression in cells transfected with pCMS-eGFP-LBAL but not those with pCMS-eGFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b,c</xref>), and increased the dimethyl H3K4 level at the LBAL site in the linearized plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that LSD1 regulates <italic>ATN1</italic> expression through the modulation of LBAL methylation status. In addition, the LBAL site may play a role as an enhancer for gene expression and its activity is likely to be regulated by increased H3K4 methylation level.</p>

        <title><italic>ATN1</italic> expression is associated with H3K4 methylation levels at LBAL</title>
        <p>The knockdown of the SET1/MLL histone methyltransferase complex subunits, RbBP5 and Dpy-30, has been reported to direct the differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells along the neural lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, with concomitant defects in gene repression, including <italic>ATN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). In addition, we have shown above that LSD1 regulates <italic>ATN1</italic> expression and NPC differentiation. Thus, we hypothesized that LSD1 could maintain a progenitor state in NPCs by antagonizing methyltransferase activity to regulate <italic>ATN1</italic> expression. To test this, the expression of <italic>ATN1</italic> in the embryonic brain was examined. ATN1 immunoreactivity was high relative to the nuclear (4&#x2032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) signal in the apical progenitor cells within the VZ, lower in the intermediate/basal progenitors of the SVZ, the lowest in the IZ and higher in neurons in the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Similarly, <italic>ATN1</italic> expression in Nestin<sup>+</sup>-cultured NPCs was substantially higher than in Tuj1<sup>+</sup>-differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). These results imply that a downregulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression is required for differentiation to occur, after which the levels again increase. To test this, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were withdrawn from the culture medium to induce differentiation of NPCs in a neurosphere culture. Within 2&#x2013;6&#x2009;h of growth factor withdrawal, <italic>ATN1</italic> mRNA levels decreased, followed by an increase at 12&#x2013;36&#x2009;h, a trend similar to what was observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether the histone methylation levels at LBAL site was associated with the regulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression during NPC differentiation, neurosphere cultures were subjected to growth factor withdrawal, to induce differentiation, and different histone methylation modification levels at LBAL were evaluated by ChIP&#x2013;qPCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>, H3K4 dimethylation levels at LBAL increased very significantly at 6&#x2009;h after growth factor withdrawal but dropped relatively at 36&#x2009;h, corresponding to the expression of <italic>ATN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Meanwhile, the H3K4 and H3K9 monomethylation levels were not apparently changed. Although the dimethyl H3K9 levels increased 6&#x2009;h after growth factor withdrawal, similar to tranylcypromine-treated NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), it&#x2019;s enrichment was also much lower than that of H3K4.</p>
        <p>To investigate the role of LBAL in the regulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, linerated pCMS-eGFP or pCMS-eGFP-LBAL together with control or shLSD1 were introduced into NPCs of E16.5 rat brain via IUE and were analysed at E19.5. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>, the GFP levels in the cells expressing pCMS-eGFP were similar in the VZ and SVZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). It was lower in the IZ, probably due to the dilution of plasmid during cortical development. However, the GFP levels in the cells expressing pCMS-eGFP-LBAL were downregulated significantly in both SVZ and IZ, reminiscent of the endogenous ATN1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>), suggesting the role of LBAL in the regulating ATN1 expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, when LSD1 was knocked down, the difference of GFP levels in the VZ and SVZ was compromised (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>), similar to the compromised expression of endogenous ATN1 in the VZ and SVZ of <italic>LSD1</italic> cKO mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c,d</xref>). These indicate that LSD1 regulates <italic>ATN1</italic> expression through the control of the histone methylation status at LBAL.</p>

        <title>ATN1 knockdown in NPCs leads to premature differentiation</title>
        <p>Given that LSD1 regulates <italic>ATN1</italic> expression, which is downregulated during NPC differentiation, the effects of ATN1 depletion on progenitor maintenance was examined. Two shRNA/eGFP constructs which were highly efficient at suppressing exogenous and endogenous <italic>ATN1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>), were electroporated into E16.5 embryos and examined 4 days later. Their effects were similar to those observed on LSD1 knockdown; that is, fewer transfected cells were observed in the proliferative zones compared with controls, and cells failed to reach the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Co-transfection of a shRNA-resistant human ATN1 construct rescued the phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), although a slight delay in migration was still observed. In addition, no apparent increase of cell death was detected in ATN1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>).</p>
        <p>The transfected cells were examined for cell fate marker expression to determine whether the loss of cells in the VZ and SVZ was due to premature differentiation of NPCs. The fraction of ATN1-deficient cells expressing the progenitor markers Sox2 and Tbr2 was dramatically lower than for control-transfected cells, while the fraction of cells expressing the neuronal protein Tuj1 was significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These results indicate that ATN1 knockdown leads to the depletion of the NPC population as a result of premature differentiation.</p>

        <title>LSD1 promotes NPC maintenance via regulation of <italic>ATN1</italic></title>
        <p>Given that depletion of ATN1 and LSD1 both induce premature differentiation, we went on to investigate whether the maintenance of NPCs controlled by LSD1 depends on the regulation of ATN1. E16.5 embryos were simultaneously electroporated with LSD1 shRNA and full-length ATN1 or control vector. The overexpression of <italic>ATN1</italic> rescued the depletion of NPCs in the VZ and SVZ caused by LSD1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). More importantly, expression of ATN1 rescued the LSD1 knockdown-induced reduction of Sox2<sup>+</sup> and Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells, and increase of Tuj1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>), indicating that the loss of LSD1 in NPCs induces their premature differentiation into neurons through the deregulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression. Thus, we would like to propose that the demethylation of LBAL site downstream of <italic>ATN1</italic> locus by LSD1 maintains the pool of cortical progenitors through the induction of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression. Inhibition, knockdown or knockout of LSD1, as well as ATN1 depletion, causes NPCs to differentiate prematurely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Histone modification is a critical mechanism of gene regulation during development. Here we provide evidence that the demethylase LSD1 and its target gene <italic>ATN1</italic> are responsible for NPC maintenance during cortical development <italic>in vivo</italic>, providing another example of how specific epigenetic marks can direct cell fate choices. Premature NPC differentiation was associated with increased H3K4 dimethylation at LBAL, the LSD1-binding site of <italic>ATN1</italic> and lower levels of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). Conversely, NPCs expressed <italic>ATN1</italic> at high levels, but had relatively low levels of dimethyl H3K4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). These changes in methylation status are probably achieved through the antagonistic activities of a methyltransferase and LSD1. A reduction in demethylase activity by LSD1 knockdown, knockout or by treatment with a LSD1 inhibitor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, would lead to increased methylation at LBAL and downregulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression, resulting in NPC differentiation (model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
      <p>A candidate methyltransferase in this model is the SET1/MLL histone methyltransferase complex. This is supported by two lines of evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). First, depletion of RbBP5 and Dpy30, two subunits of the complex, produces an effect opposite to LSD1 knockdown; namely, a defect in <italic>ATN1</italic> repression during differentiation and thus the restriction of stem cell differentiation potential along the neural lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Second, both Dpy30 and LSD1 bind to the LBAL locus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Future studies can examine whether inhibiting the activity of the SET1/MLL complex can alter methylation at LBAL in cortical progenitors and induce an expansion of the progenitor pool.</p>
      <p>Although we cannot exclude the possibility that LSD1 regulates <italic>ATN1</italic> expression levels through an indirect effect of blocking global histone demethylation, it is very likely to be that LSD1 regulates <italic>ATN1</italic> expression via controlling the histone methylation levels at LBAL. First, the expression of reporter gene with a downstream LBAL site can be suppressed by tranylcypromine treatment, similar to that of endogenous ATN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Second, reporter gene expression in cells transfected with pCMS-eGFP-LBAL is significantly lower in the SVZ than that in the VZ and this is compromised by LSD1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to deduce that the downregulation of LSD1 level during NPC differentiation in the SVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> leads to increased histone methylation levels at LBAL, and thus the corresponding decreased ATN1 expression in the SVZ as that of LSD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>).</p>
      <p>LSD1 has been shown to remove both the mono- or dimethylation of H3K4 and H3K9 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Although we are not certain that downregulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression by LSD1 inhibition is caused by increased monomethyl H3K4 or dimethyl H3K9 at the LBAL site, this kind of regulation is more likely to be mediated by dimethyl H3K4 for two reasons: One is that the H3K9 methylation levels at LBAL site in NPCs are much lower compared with that of H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4f</xref>); The other reason is that when NPCs undergo differentiation, it is changes of dimethyl H3K4, but not monomethyl H3K4 levels, that are accompanied by the alternation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although H3K4 trimethylation in promoter region has been observed to repress transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, tri- and dimethylated H3K4 are predominantly associated with the activation of gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. This maybe the reason why LSD1 is mostly reported as a transcriptional repressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In the present study, inhibition of LSD1 activity resulted in enhanced H3K4 dimethylation at LBAL in NPCs, accompanied by the downregulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> expression. It is interesting to speculate that this contradictory effect is due to the location of LBAL downstream of the <italic>ATN1</italic> coding region, instead of within the promoter as is typically the case. In this instance, a high dimethyl H3K4 level at LBAL might produce a conformational change in the chromatin that would favour transcriptional repression, perhaps by physically obstructing the access of the transcriptional complex to the promoter. Although LSD1 activates androgen receptor transcription by removal of mono- and dimethyl H3K9 (instead of H3K4) histone marks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, to the best of our knowledge our study is likely to be the first report that LSD1-involved H3K4 methylation is required for gene activation as well as NPC maintenance.</p>
      <p>Even though the present results indicate that <italic>ATN1</italic> is probably a direct target of LSD1 in the regulation of NPC maintenance, there are some aspects of the mechanism that remain unclear. For instance, ATN1 has been reported to interact with and modulate the repressor activity of TLX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, while loss of TLX function also induces premature differentiation of NPCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, raising the possibility that ATN1 exerts its effect on progenitor fate through TLX. LSD1 and TLX have also been shown to directly interact and coordinately repress target gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Therefore, LSD1 could regulate ATN1 directly, or else indirectly through TLX. Alternatively, LSD1, ATN1 and TLX could interact within a single complex. Reduced levels of ATN1 could disrupt the repressor complex that normally suppresses differentiation and maintains progenitors in a state of self-renewal, resulting in the derepression of differentiation-promoting genes.</p>
      <p>In addition to the epigenetic regulation of <italic>ATN1</italic> by LSD1 during embryonic brain development, <italic>ATN1</italic> expression in the adult brain would be investigated in the future to determine whether it can be suppressed by the LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine, which is currently prescribed for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders in the clinic. If that is the case, given that DRPLA is caused by the aggregation of ATN1, tranylcypromine could be tried for the prevention and alleviation of some DRPLA symptoms.</p>

        <title>Model of NPC maintenance by epigenetic regulation of ATN1 by LSD1.</title>
        <p>In cycling NPCs, LSD1 maintains a low level of H3K4 dimethylation at the LBAL site of ATN1, resulting in a high level of ATN1 expression. In differentiating NPCs, H3K4 dimethylation at LBAL is increased, probably due to antagonistic methyltransferase activity, leading to decreased ATN1 expression and neuronal differentiation. When LSD1 demethylase activity is lost due to knockdown, knockout or tranylcypromine treatment, NPCs prematurely differentiate into neurons.</p>
